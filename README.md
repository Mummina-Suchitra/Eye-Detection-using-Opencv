# Eye-Detection-using-Opencv
This project implements real-time eye detection using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade classifier. It captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect eyes, and highlights them with green rectangles. This program can be useful for eye-tracking applications, gaze detection, and basic computer vision projects.
